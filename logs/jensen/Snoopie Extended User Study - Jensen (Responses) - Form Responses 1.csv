I think there definitely are things that would need to be polished for a real deployable system but it was helpful and fun to work with.

I felt the pace and intervals were good for my current capabilities.,"The dog still needed to be guided past shadows sometimes which felt a little disrupting, and sometimes it looked a little unstable which made me concerned it could fall.","Maybe it would be useful to have more input in the pace, or some kind of progression in the speed or interval lengths as I improve with my leg."

While this was more tiring than usual it felt good to have some motivation to progress more while not being too intense.","It was pretty hot out and that combined with the faster pace today made things a bit more uncomfortable, but it wasn't anything too bad. There were also still some unexpected pauses and interruptions like prior times but it wasn't too distracting.","I think next time I'll think more about the pace I set for it during calibration, this time I didn't think too much about it and it resulted in a pace faster than I expected, but like I mentioned before I think there were positive aspects to that. Also, I didn't mention this before but both today and prior times the dog definitely gets a lot of attention from spectators who ask questions and generally show interest in it, which I think adds to the experience for myself and makes things more interesting."

The dog's slow interval was also slower today which made it more comfortable to keep up with it by just walking.,Still some minor issues with the dog going off course or abruptly stopping.,"I think I feel more comfortable running now, my knee feels better and doesn't strain as much."

It doesn't feel like I run as far as I actually do, which is good.",Still a few interruptions but nothing too bad.,"I feel like my progression has been going well, my leg feels less strained each time and I think I could run for longer than the interval if I wanted to, which I don't think was the case before."
